# ML_Trading_Strategies
This project examines the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in Systematic Trading Strategies.
Specifically we apply ML on the asset pricing part of the strategy (returns prediction), using fundamental data corresponding to stylised factors of returns, for 200 US stocks. 
The ML algorithms tested are Random Forest, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks. 
We also apply Feature Engineering on our data and Portfolio Construction/Optimisation methods.
